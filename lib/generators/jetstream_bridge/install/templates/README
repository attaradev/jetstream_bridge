# JetstreamBridge Installation Guide

## ✅ Installation Complete

The initializer has been created at:
`config/initializers/jetstream_bridge.rb`

If you passed flags, the following migrations were also created:
- `--inbox`  → `db/migrate/*_create_jetstream_inbox_events.rb`
- `--outbox` → `db/migrate/*_create_jetstream_outbox_events.rb`

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   bin/rails db:migrate
   ```

2. **Set your destination app** in your environment (e.g., `hw` or `pwas`).

3. **Start publishing/consuming** using:
   - `JetstreamBridge::Publisher`
   - `JetstreamBridge::Consumer`

---

## Usage Examples

### Initial setup with both migrations:
```sh
bundle exec rails jetstream_bridge:install --inbox --outbox
```

### Only inbox:
```sh
bundle exec rails jetstream_bridge:install --inbox
```

### Only outbox:
```sh
bundle exec rails jetstream_bridge:install --outbox
```

### Just the initializer:
```sh
bundle exec rails jetstream_bridge:install
```
